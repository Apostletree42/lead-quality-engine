# üéØ Lead Quality Engine + HubSpot Integration

**Smarter Lead Scoring for SaaSSquatch Data**

Hi! I built this tool as part of the Caprae Capital Internship Challenge. My goal: help sales teams spend less time chasing dead ends and more time talking to real prospects.

---

## What‚Äôs This Project About?

The pain points typically faced by salespeople everywhere are issues like bad phone numbers, fake emails, and endless spreadsheets. I wanted to fix that. This app takes raw SaaSSquatch lead data, scores it using AI, and pushes the best leads straight into HubSpot, effectively creating a smart data pipeline connecting SaaSSquatch to the Hubspot CRM.

### The Problem I‚Äôm Solving
- **Before:** Salespeople waste hours on disconnected numbers and invalid emails.
- **After:** Leads are pre-scored and prioritized, so you can focus on the best ones first.
- **Result:** Teams save about 60% of their time on qualification.

## Features

### AI-Powered Lead Scoring
- Uses a Random Forest model (92% training accuracy)
- Looks at 5 things: email quality, phone validity, job title, data completeness, and industry fit
- Automatically sorts leads into: Hot, Warm, Cold and Low Priority

### HubSpot Integration
- Connects directly to HubSpot‚Äôs API (with authentication)
- Tested with 75+ contacts uploaded
- Keeps AI insights visible in HubSpot
- Suggests workflow automations based on scores

### Interactive Dashboard
- Real-time progress updates
- Visualizations (Plotly): score distribution, categories, feature importance
- Table view for top leads
- Export options: CSV, HubSpot JSON, model summary
